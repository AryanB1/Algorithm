# Encryption-Algorithm
## Encryption
- The encryption algorithm functions by generating a unique large random number for every character that needs to be encrpyted, and performs a series of mathematical operations on the string input. After completing the operations, the encryption algorithm returns the encrpyted string, and a decryption key which a user can use to convert the series of numbers back into readable text. 
## Decryption
- The decrpytion algorithm takes in the encrpyted text, and uses the decrpytion key to reverse the mathematical operations done by the enccryption key 
## Future Plans
- Support all characters in UTF-8, rather than only supporting ASCII
- Use the ctime library to allow users to set a maximum time for which a string can be decrypted
